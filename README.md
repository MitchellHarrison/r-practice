# Welcome to my R Notebook
_no pun intended_

This is my place for keeping my little practice problems/notes while I learn R for school.
All that's here are quick-and-dirty projects or notes. I decided to make it public in case anyone
wanted to learn with me. A similar repository exists for my [Java learning journey](https://github.com/MitchellHarrison/java-practice). Enjoy!
